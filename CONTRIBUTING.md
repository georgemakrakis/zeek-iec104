# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to zeek-iec104. Based on you input we can create a great tool!

Following these guidelines helps us to communicate efficiently, and better managing and developing this open source project. This can assist in smoothly addressing issues, assessing changes, and helping finalizing pull requests.

There are mainly three ways to contribute, testing the parser using PCAPs that are not included in this repository, improving the documentation, and submitting bug reports and feature requests.

Please, do not contribute anything that is beyond the scope of a parser in Zeek. An example of that could be the integration of Zeek with other systems/tools.
